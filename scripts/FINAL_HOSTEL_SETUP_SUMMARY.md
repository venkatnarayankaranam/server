## 🔄 **APPROVAL WORKFLOW**

### **Automatic Routing Logic:**
```
Student Submits Request
       ↓
📍 System reads student's hostelBlock and floor from students collection
       ↓
🏠 Route to Floor Incharge (based on floor + block)
       ↓
🏢 Forward to Hostel Incharge (based on block)
       ↓
👑 Escalate to Warden (based on block)
       ↓
✅ Final Approval & Gate Pass Generation
```

### **Example Routing:**
- **Student in D-Block, 3rd Floor** → floorincharge3.d@kietgroup.com → hostelincharge.d@kietgroup.com → warden.d@kietgroup.com
- **Student in E-Block, 1st Floor** → floorincharge1.e@kietgroup.com → hostelincharge.e@kietgroup.com → warden.e@kietgroup.com

  const student = await db.collection('students').findOne({ rollNumber: studentRollNumber });
  const floorNum = student.floor.charAt(0);  // 1, 2, 3, 4
  const blockCode = student.hostelBlock === 'D-Block' ? 'd' : 'e';
  
  return {
    floorIncharge: `floorincharge${floorNum}.${blockCode}@kietgroup.com`,
    hostelIncharge: `hostelincharge.${blockCode}@kietgroup.com`,
    warden: `warden.${blockCode}@kietgroup.com`
  };
};
```

### **2. Notification System:**
- Email notifications to approval chain
